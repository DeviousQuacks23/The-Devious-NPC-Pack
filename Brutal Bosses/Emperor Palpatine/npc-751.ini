description = "A boss enemy. When first spawned, he will have an electric shield that will knock back players and harm NPCs. After he does this a few times, his shield will be temporarily disabled. This is your chance to deal some damage to him, as he will regain his shield after a while. After 12 hits, he will be stunned and the only way to defeat him is by blowing him up with Bobby's firepower."
