If you want to trigger the alarm with an event, read this!

First, you'll have to load the toppingJumpscare library into your luna.lua file:
local toppingJumpscare = require("toppingJumpscare")

Then, load the lua event 'onEvent'.
For example:

function onEvent(eventName)
end

You'll have to add a check for if the event name is the correct one.
Let's say my event name is "wakeUp", we'll do:
if eventName == "wakeUp" then

Now, we just have to add this function:

toppingJumpscare.riseAndShine()

So, we should have something like this:

--------------------------------------------------------------------

local toppingJumpscare = require("toppingJumpscare")

function onEvent(eventName)
        if eventName == "wakeUp" then
                toppingJumpscare.riseAndShine()
        end
end
